//we use class to create objects
//classes are not themeseleve objects but they describe what an object is or is a blueprint of the object but it isnt the object
//class has a name or "type"
//and has attributes or "properties or data" and behaviour or "operations or method(in coding language)"
//and a method is a function declared within the class
//each object is an instance of the class and the process of creation is called instantiation
