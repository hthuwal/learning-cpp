1. A bstraction - focus on essential qualities of something rather than one particular example or instance---gnore the irrelevant


2. p olymorphism 


3. I nheritance


4. E ncapsulation- idea of surrounding to keep contents toghether and protect them - first refers to taking attributes and behaviour and bundling them together in the same unit or class
//and also restrict access to inner working of the class or object of the class also known as data hiding----object should not reveal anything about itself apart from what is extremely 
//necessary for using the class
